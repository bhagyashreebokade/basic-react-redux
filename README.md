# basic-react-redux
Basic react-redux app, created from create-react-app

This is a very basic app, that demonstrates how we can get the state from redux only using the basic 'store.' functions; example: store.getState, store.dispatch, store.subscribe.

This app has a functional component, that will call the reducer to update the state and display the updated state on the view.
